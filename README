The purpose of libstaroffice is to build a filter for old StarOffice's
documents(.sdw, ...) based on librevenge(see
https://sourceforge.net/p/libwpd/wiki/librevenge/ and
http://www.documentliberation.org/projects/ ).

Actually, it only tries to parse the main SDW's OLEs and prints
"ERROR: Parse Exception!"(ie. it does not convert any files) excepted
if it is configured with --enable-full-debug(if so, it creates some
"*.ascii" files in the current repository to show what is parsed)...
