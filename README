The purpose of libstaroffice is to build a filter for old StarOffice's
documents(.sdc, .sdw, ...) based on librevenge(see
https://sourceforge.net/p/libwpd/wiki/librevenge/ and
http://www.documentliberation.org/projects/ ).

Currently:
- .sdc files: it tries to convert the main content of a .sdc files, ie. the
  cells' value/text/formula, the cells' comments and the cells'
  formattings. But it does not try to retrieve formatting in the bock
  of texts or any embedded charts, pictures, ...
- .sda files: it tries to retrieve some basic contents, ie. the basic shapes
  (lines, rectangles, ellipse, ...), the bitmaps and some formattings. But
  this parser is still incomplete: many formattings are simply ignored, all
  text formatting are ignored and it does not try to retrieve any embedded
  objects, ...
- .sdg files: it tries to retrieve all the bitmap .bm in the files. Other
  objects are simply ignored and some bitmaps are reconstructed with bad
  vertical orientations, ...
- other .sd? files: it refuses to convert them, ...

Notes:
- when configured with --enable-full-debug, it also tries to parse
  other StarOffice's files and it creates some "*.ascii" files in the
  current repository(to show what is parsed) ; but of course, it still
  does not generate any output...
